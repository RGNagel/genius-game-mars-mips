* This is a simple version of Genius Game

- *Before* assembling, set it up in MARS:

  - mark the following boxes in /Settings/:
    - /Assemble all files in directory/
    - /Initialize Program Counter to global 'main' if defined/
  - unmark /DAD/ in MMIO simulator
  - *bitmap* address should be mapped to /heap/ (this is a workaround to a problem of overlapping data in data segment)
  - *bitmap display* must have a proportion of /128/ (changeable in =.data=) between /width/ and /unit width/ and /height/ and /unit height/
